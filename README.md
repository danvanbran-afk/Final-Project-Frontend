# Music Review Platform

## Description
A full-stack single-page application (SPA) built for music enthusiasts to discover albums, track their favorite artists, and share reviews. The platform utilizes a decoupled architecture with a React frontend and an Express/Node.js REST API backend.

## Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React (Hooks, Context API), React Router, Axios, Vite.
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, RESTful API architecture.
* **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose.
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcryptjs for password hashing.

## Data Models
The application relies on 3 primary data models with relational referencing:
1. **User:** Stores authentication credentials and user profile data.
2. **Album:** Stores music metadata (Title, Artist, Genre, Release Year).
3. **Review:** Stores user-generated content, referencing both the User who created it and the Album it targets (2 Relationships).

## Features
* **Authentication:** Secure user signup, login, and session management using JWT.
* **Global State:** Real-time UI updates reflecting user authentication status via React Context.
* **CRUD Operations:** 
  * Create: Users can post reviews to specific albums.
  * Read: Fetch dynamic lists of albums and specific album detail views.
  * Update: Users can modify their existing reviews.
  * Delete: Users can remove their reviews from the database.
* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first architecture ensuring accessibility across all devices.
* **Error Handling:** Graceful API error catching and custom 404 routing.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
